                <p>Last but certainly not least: The high damage kombo strings. There are not much kombo's, but they're pretty complicated.</p>

                <ul><li><div class="third"> 1-1-2 cancel into gutted, amplify, Jump punch, f4, db3</div> This is the 36% damage kombo. As you can see, you only amplify once, so you'll use one offensive bar from your meter. You don't <strong>have</strong> to start the combo with 1-1-2, you can use anything, as long as you make sure to cancel into Gutted (bf4). Once you hit you're opponent, they have no way of escaping, exept if they use their brakeaway, wich costs them both of they're defensive meter.</p>
                <li><div class="third">1-1-2 cancel into Gutted, apmlify, 4 1-1-2 gutted</div> This is our first corner kombo. When you hit an opponent, they will always move, either a little bit or a lot. But when they reach the conrner, that will not happen anymore. that is what this kombo takes advantage of. The timings are a bit tricky at first, but practice definitly makes perferct. Keep practising, cause this kombo does about 42% damage!

                <p>these are basically the main kombo's for Baraka, but if you want to see all sorts of options that you can do with these strings, you can watch Mtn Dew The Joker's video, just click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGNd3MbPI_M" target="_blank"> here</a>.
