                <p><p>Baraka has some very useful special attacks. I will be explaining what attacks to use and when to use them. I'll only write about the Marauder variation, cause there are a <strong>lot</strong> of other special attacks and I know Marauder best.</p>
            
                <ul><li><div class="second">Blade Spark (db1).</div> The Blade spark creates a spark ball that shoots out at the opponent, wich makes it a projectile. The damage is average and the plus frames are pretty high, but that's normal. Blade Spark is good for zoning (throwing projectiles), but it shouldn't be all that Baraka does. I use it to hold off my opponent, so I can slowly come forward.</p>
                    <li><div class="second">War Banner (db4).</div> This is <strong>not</strong> an attack. War Banner is a move that increases the damage for a short period of time. Baraka plants a flag that increases his damage, but stops increasing it if it disappears. War Banner is almost never used, because it has major plus frames, allowing the enemy to put pressure on Baraka. The only time I use it, is from a great distance from the enemy, to increase my Blade Spark damage.</p>
                    <li><div class="second">Gutted (bf4).</div> This move is the best one of 'em all, because this move allowes Baraka the get high damage. Baraka stabs his opponent and headbutts him, knocking them in the corner. However if you amplify (R1/RB), then this move will launch the enemy in the air. This allowes for high damage string that does about 36% damage.</p>
                    <li><div class="second">Chop Chop (db3).</div> Chop Chop is the most known move Baraka and it is pretty useful. It is found in big kombo's to get maximum damage. The Chop Chop is also good individually, because it is hard to block.</li>
